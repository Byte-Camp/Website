                    work with a partner to build their own clay characters, sets and props, develop their own 
                    script, shoot their movie scene, and then learn to edit and add sounds and special effects 
                    to complete the whole project. Don't worry parents, there will be plenty of time devoted to 
                    outdoor games and activities!`
